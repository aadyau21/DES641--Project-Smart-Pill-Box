To run these codes, follow these steps-
1. Install ARUDINO IDE.
2. Install necessary Libraries like HX711, etc.
3. Install driver like CH3430
4. Now the system is ready to run the code. Run the codes attached.
5. Code 1- CODE- Basic Testing code for all sensors to check if sensors are working.
6. Code 2- FINALCODE- Final code along with Webserver integration when finally every sensor and module works correctly only to display the necessary results.
7. Code 3- FINALCODESTATUSCHECK- Code  with sensor working data integration.
8. Code 4- HTML- HTML webserver code integrated with Code for screen display content input.
9. NOTE- Install necessary libraries to ensure smooth working on each of these codes.
10. INPUT- Enter the Pill Name in CODE2,3,4 whenever no output is seen on Serial Monitor.
                - Once the Pill Name is entered, it will ask for Pill Taking Time.
                - Once the Pill Takig Time is entered, it wil ask for Compartment Number.
11. OUTPUT- Input is done, It will print output according to the sensing in the compartment.
12. To access Webserver,
                 - Change the Wifi SSID and Password in the Code.
                 - Enter the ESP8266 IP Address  provided on Serial Monitor on web browser and It will show the necessary results.  
13. If all of the above works fine, 
                     YOU HAVE REACHED THE END OF PROJECT.
